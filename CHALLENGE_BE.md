# Backend Engineer Challenge #


#### REST VS RESTFull ####


### Problem ###

We need to research about locales where consumer complains are made. That complains should have at least the attributes described bellow:
 - Title
 - Description
 - Locale
 - Company
 
Can you provide some services to ingest complains and get some data about its geolocation? For example, to find how many complains a specific company has in specific city?


### Recommendations ###
 - Use Restful instead Rest
 - Use microservice design if possible
 - Use a NoSql Database (if you use a database in your purpose)
 - We need to scale your services, decouple your modules if possible
 - Use devops mindset
 - Use your preferred language and patterns
 
### Definition Of Done ###
 - A repository with read access to andre.rocha@reclameaqui.com.br, marcelo.pereira@reclameaqui.com.br, guilherme.branco@reclameaqui.com.br, diego@reclameaqui.com.br ( feel free to choose your provider )
 - Documented, clean and testable/tested code
 - Documented strategy to deploy and run your code ( on cloud if possible )
